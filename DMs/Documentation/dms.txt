--DMs (Chat)--
-> If a user initiates the chat, a server will be created with them as its host; they will also be added as a client.
-> The host will be able to make any users in the chat an admin, kick them (closing their connection), or mute them (removing their ability to send messages).
-> Admins can kick/mute a user who is not an admin/host.
-> Admins and the host can invite more people from the Search application.
-> Communication shall be done under TCP.
-> Any time the server notices that there are fewer than two people, a countdown of 3 minutes is started. Once the countdown reaches zero, the connections and chat are closed.
-> The server will allow at most 20 active connections from users.
-> If the host closes connections, all other active users are notified and their connections are closed.
-> An input box for users to type messages into.
-> Messages cannot be empty; they are encoded in ASCII and tracked only during the current session (from server creation to its closure).
-> Messages will be preceded by the username of the sender and have at most 500 characters.
-> The server will keep track of at most 100 messages, after which they will be forgotten, allowing a new batch of messages.
-> Users will be able to clear the messages from their screens.
