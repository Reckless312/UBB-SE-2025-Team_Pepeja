--Search--
-> A search bar for the user to find other people who use the platform using their username.
-> Input will be checked if it is a substring of a particular username; in that case, the username will be shown.
-> The list of users received will be sorted by their username alphabetically in ascending order. The user will be able to switch to descending or back to the original state via a button.
-> The number of displayed users shall be limited to 10.
-> If no users are found, a simple "No users found." message will be displayed.
-> Alongside the username, an option to invite the user to chat will appear.
-> The page will also contain a list of incoming invites to chat, sorted by the date sent (earliest to latest).
-> Each invite can be accepted or rejected.
-> The number of displayed invites shall be limited to 10.
-> Accepting an invitation will open the DM application.
-> The search will handle at most 100 connections to the database.

--DMs (Chat)--
-> If a user initiates the chat, a server will be created with them as its host; they will also be added as a client.
-> The host will be able to make any users in the chat an admin, kick them (closing their connection), or mute them (removing their ability to send messages).
-> Admins can kick/mute a user who is not an admin/host.
-> Admins and the host can invite more people from the Search application.
-> Communication shall be done under TCP.
-> Any time the server notices that there are fewer than two people, a countdown of 3 minutes is started. Once the countdown reaches zero, the connections and chat are closed.
-> The server will allow at most 20 active connections from users.
-> If the host closes connections, all other active users are notified and their connections are closed.
-> An input box for users to type messages into.
-> Messages cannot be empty; they are encoded in ASCII and tracked only during the current session (from server creation to its closure).
-> Messages will be preceded by the username of the sender and have at most 500 characters.
-> The server will keep track of at most 100 messages, after which they will be forgotten, allowing a new batch of messages.
-> Users will be able to clear the messages from their screens.
