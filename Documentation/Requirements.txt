		- Each user may only submit one rating, which they can later change or remove
	-> Notes:
		- Posts can be edited, created, and deleted indefinitely only by the developers associated to the game the news page is dedicated to. If a developer wants to edit or delete another developer's post they are free to do so.
		- Only the developers of the game associated with the news page may create posts
		- Each poster will have the option to format their text (excluding the title) using html mark-ups. Formatting would enable the following: bold text, italic text, strikethrough text, superscript and subscript text, headings (h1, h2, and h3), images (sourced from the web only), and spoiler text.

-> Paging of this sort would require the user to have a stable internet connection with a download speed of at least 100 Mbps if they expect data to arrive in under a second
-> Due to memory costs and considering the scale of this app, each post will load all associated comments once it's opened

-> A search bar will be included to enable the user to search posts
