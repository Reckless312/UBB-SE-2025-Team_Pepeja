-> Nomenclature
	- Users = Registered individuals
	- Developers = Users that develop games
	- Non-Developers = Users that are not Developers
-> Will be unique to each game: every game will have its own dedicated 'news' section
-> Each 'news' section will be accessible only through its respective game's page (Should discuss this with the 'games' team)

-> Will contain posts, ordered from newest to oldest with the following features:
	-> Upload Date
	-> Profile picture of the author
	-> Username of the author
	-> Body: 
		- Between 1 and 5.000 UTF-16 characters. This includes: plain text, mark-ups, embedded links (Youtube only), and hyperlinks.
	-> Comments section: 
		- Between 0 and 500 comments
		- Can be used by both developers and users alike
	-> Ratings:
		- Between 0 and 2(2^31 - 1) total ratings
		- Each rating can be either a like or a dislike
		- Each user may only submit one rating, which they can later change or remove
	-> Notes:
		- Posts can be edited, created, and deleted indefinitely only by the developers associated to the game the news page is dedicated to. If a developer wants to edit or delete another developer's post they are free to do so.
		- Only the developers of the game associated with the news page may create posts
		- Each poster will have the option to format their text (excluding the title) using html mark-ups. Formatting would enable the following: bold text, italic text, strikethrough text, superscript and subscript text, headings (h1, h2, and h3), images (sourced from the web only), and spoiler text.

-> Comments will be ordered from best to most controversial (based on the difference between the number of likes and dislikes they've received) and will contain the following features:
	-> Profile picture of the author
	-> Username of the author
	-> Body:
		- Between 1 and 3.000 UTF-16 characters. This includes: plain text and mark-ups
	-> Notes:
		- Each comment can be edited or removed indefinitely by its author
		- Each commenter will have the option to format their text using html mark-ups. Formatting would enable the following: bold text, italic text, strikethrough text, superscript and subscript text, headings (h1, h2, and h3), images (sourced from the web only), and spoiler text.

-> Initially, only the 9 most recent posts will be loaded on the front page. After the user scrolls through them all, the next 9 will load along with the previous ones, continuing until a total of 90 posts have been rendered on the user's device.
-> Paging of this sort would require the user to have a stable internet connection with a download speed of at least 100 Mbps if they expect data to arrive in under a second
-> Due to memory costs and considering the scale of this app, each post will load all associated comments once it's opened

-> A search bar will be included to enable the user to search posts
-> The input the user can enter into the search bar must be between 0 and 200 UTF-16 characters long
-> If the user performs a search using an empty string, they'll be taken to the default page described above
-> Searching involves taking the user input from the search bar and matching its contents against the contents of the posts
